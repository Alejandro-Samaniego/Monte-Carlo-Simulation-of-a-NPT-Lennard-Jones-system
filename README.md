# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-of-a-NPT-Lennard-Jones-system
A Monte Carlo (MC) code for (N,P,T) simulations of Lennard-Jones (LJ) systems has been created as a final project for the Simulation of Condensed Matter course.  
The characteristics of the simulation are presented in the leap-lj.data file which is in the "Code" folder.  
A series of MC simulations at T∗ = 2.0 and pressures from P∗ = 0.15 to P∗ = 15 have been carried out.  
The data extracted from the simulation was used to calculate thermodynamical properties such as: the Energy per atom, the Virial pressure and the radial distribution function.
